Isaiah Jamar Thomas (born February 7, 1989) is
an American professional basketball player for
the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National
Basketball Association (NBA). The 5-foot-9-inch
(1.75 m) point guard played three years of
college basketball for the Washington Huskies
and was a three-time all-conference selection in
the Pac-10. After electing to forgo his senior year
in college, Thomas was selected by the Sacramento
Kings with the final pick in the 2011 NBA draft.
He spent three seasons with the Kings before
joining the Phoenix Suns in 2014. Thomas was
acquired by the Boston Celtics in February 2015 
and went on to earn NBA All-Star nods in 2016 and
2017, as well as All-NBA Team honors in 2017 after
leading the Celtics to the first seed in the Eastern
Conference. In August 2017, he was sent to the
Cavaliers in a five-player trade.
