Giannis Antetokounmpo (born December 6, 1994) is
a Greek professional basketball player for the
Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball
Association (NBA). He stands at 6 ft 11 in
(2.11 m), and while he primarily plays the small
forward position, he also plays as a guard due
to his ball-handling skills. During the 2015–16
season, he became the Bucks' primary playmaker.
In 2016–17, he led the Bucks in all five major
statistical categories and became the first
player in NBA history to finish a regular season
in the top 20 in total points, rebounds, assists,
steals, and blocks. He is nicknamed the
"Greek Freak" due to his heritage and athleticism.
