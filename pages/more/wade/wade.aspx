Dwyane Tyrone Wade Jr. (born January 17, 1982)
is an American professional basketball player
for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National
Basketball Association (NBA). After a successful
college career at Marquette, Wade was drafted
fifth overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Miami
Heat. He was named to the All-Rookie team and the
All-Star team the following twelve seasons. In
his third season, Wade led the Heat to their
first NBA championship in franchise history and
was named the 2006 NBA Finals MVP. At the 2008
Summer Olympics, Wade led the United States men's
basketball team, commonly known as the
"Redeem Team", in scoring, and helped them capture
gold medal honors in Beijing, China. In the 2008–09
season, Wade led the league in scoring and earned
his first NBA scoring title. With LeBron James and
Chris Bosh, Wade helped guide Miami to four
consecutive NBA Finals from 2011 to 2014, winning
back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013.
In 2016, Wade departed the Heat in free agency to
play for his hometown Chicago Bulls, then leaving
them after one season to join the Cavaliers.
