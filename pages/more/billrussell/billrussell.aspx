William Felton Russell (born February 12, 1934)
is an American retired professional basketball
player. Russell played center for the Boston
Celtics of the National Basketball Association
(NBA) from 1956 to 1969. A five-time NBA Most
Valuable Player and a twelve-time All-Star, he
was the centerpiece of the Celtics dynasty,
winning eleven NBA championships during his
thirteen-year career. Russell holds the record
for the most championships won by an athlete in
a North American sports league (tied with Henri
Richard of the National Hockey League). Before his
professional career, Russell led the University of
San Francisco to two consecutive NCAA championships
(1955, 1956), and he captained the gold-medal winning
U.S. national basketball team at the 1956 Summer
Olympics.
