Dirk Werner Nowitzki (born June 19, 1978) is a
German professional basketball player for the
Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball
Association (NBA). An alumnus of Röntgen
Gymnasium and the DJK Würzburg basketball
club, Nowitzki was chosen as the ninth pick in
the 1998 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks and
immediately traded to the Mavericks, where he has
played since. Listed at 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m),
Nowitzki is considered to be one of the greatest
power forwards of all time. He is also one of
only seven players ever to play at least 20
seasons in the NBA.
