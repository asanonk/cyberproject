Julius Winfield Erving II
(born February 22, 1950), commonly known by the
nickname Dr. J, is an American retired
basketball player who helped popularize a
modern style of play that emphasizes leaping
and playing above the rim. Erving helped
legitimize the American Basketball Association
(ABA) and was the best-known player in that league
when it merged with the National Basketball
Association (NBA) after the 1975–76 season.
