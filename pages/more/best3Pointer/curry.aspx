Wardell Stephen Curry II (born March 14, 1988),
commonly known as Stephen Curry and sometimes as
Steph Curry, is an American professional basketball
player for the Golden State Warriors of the
National Basketball Association (NBA). Many
players and analysts have called him the greatest
shooter in NBA history.[1] In 2014–15, Curry won
the NBA Most Valuable Player Award and led the
Warriors to their first championship since 1975.
The following season, he became the first player
in NBA history to be elected MVP by a unanimous
vote and to lead the league in scoring while
shooting above 50–40–90. That same year, the
Warriors broke the record for the most wins in
an NBA season. Curry helped the Warriors return
to the NBA Finals for a third straight year in
2017, where he won his second NBA championship.
